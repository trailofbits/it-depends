# SIEVE Blockchain Dependency Info

To run this, simply execute the following after creating and pasting your GitHub access token:

```bash
docker-compose up

docker build -t it-depends .

docker run -v "$(pwd):/home/dependabot/it-depends" \
    -w /home/dependabot/it-depends \
    it-depends \
    bundle install --jobs=8 --path vendor

docker run -v "$(pwd):/home/dependabot/it-depends" \
    -w /home/dependabot/it-depends \
    -e "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN" \
    it-depends \
    bundle exec ruby ./dependabot.rb --directory "/" --repo-name "ethereum/go-ethereum" --use-database
```

To login to the Neo4j instance, go to `http://localhost:7474/` with username `neo4j` and password `password`. After running the above, type in some [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/) (start with `MATCH (a) RETURN a` to see everything) to start querying the database.

## Options

The `--directory` option is to help point dependabot to the directory where the dependency file(s) reside.

The `--repo-name` option is the path to a GitHub repo. More directions on how to look at other repos will be updated later.

The `--use-database` option will try to connect to the database started through `docker-compose`.

By default, the script tries looking for all dependabot-supported dependency files.

## Dev environment

Use VS Code and select to reopen in dev container when it pops up.

## TODO for this script

* Save results in a database of some kind. DONE in neo4j

* Figure out the best way to process a large number of GitHub repos:

  * Check for all dependency files in parallel within the script

  * The startup time for the script is pretty long... Might be more efficient to process `n` repos per script run instead of one at a time.

* Some way to prevent redownloading a GitHub repo based on some property (same SHA, dependency file(s) haven't changed, etc.)

## Other notes

See [notes.md](./notes.md) for more general notes about what to do with this information.

Since I have zero experience with Ruby other than this, I think post-processing the results with Python would be best for anything that isn't easy to grab from Dependabot.
