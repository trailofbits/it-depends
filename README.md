It-Depends is a tool to automatically build a dependency graph and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for packages and arbitrary source code repositories. You can use it to enumerate all third party dependencies for a software package, map those dependencies to known security vulnerabilities, as well as compare the similarity between two packages based on their dependencies.

To the best of our knowledge, It-Depends is the only such tool with the following features:
  * Support for C/C++ projects (both autootools and cmake)
  * Automated resolution of native library dependencies partially based on dynamic analysis (_e.g._, the Python package `pytz` depends on the native library `libtinfo.so.6`)
  * Enumeration of _all possible_ dependency resolutions, not just a _single feasible_ resolution
  * A comparison metric for the similarity between two packages based on their dependency graph

## Features ‚≠ê
 * Supports Go, JavaScript, Rust, Python, and C/C++ projects.
 * Accepts source code repositories or package specifications like `pip:it-depends`
 * Extracts dependencies of cmake/autotool repostories without building it
 * Finds native dependencies for high level languages like Python or JavaScript
 * Provides visualization based on vis.js or dot
 * Matches dependencies and CVEs
 * Export Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)
   * Machine-intelligible JSON output
   * Support for the SPDX standard is [in active development](https://github.com/trailofbits/it-depends/tree/dev/spdx)

### Can It-Depends Do It? It Depends. üçã
 * It-Depends does not detect vendored or copy/pasted dependencies
 * Results from build systems like autotools and cmake that entail arbitrary computation at install time are 
   best-effort
 * Resolution of native dependencies is best-effort
   * Some native dependencies are resolved through dynamic analysis
   * Native dependencies are inferred by cross-referencing file requirements against paths provided by the Ubuntu 
     package repository; dependencies may be different across other Linux distributions or Ubuntu versions
 * It-Depends attempts to resolve *all* possible package versions that satisfy a dependency
   * It-Depends *does not* find a single satisfying package resolution
   * The list of resolved packages is intended to be a superset of the packages required by the installation of
     a package on any system
   * The `--audit` feature may discover vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies that are either not exploitable in the 
     target package or are in a package version that cannot exist in any valid dependency resolution of the target
     package
 * It-Depends caches data that it expects to be immutable in a local database
   * If a package is ever deleted or yanked from a package repository after it was already cached, It-Depends will 
     continue to use the cached data unless the cache is cleared with `--clear-cache`


## Quickstart üöÄ
```commandline
$ pip3 install it-depends
```

### Running it üèÉ
Run `it-depends` in the root of the source repository you would like to analyze:
```console
$ cd /path/to/project
$ it-depends
```
or alternatively point it to the path directly:
```console
$ it-depends /path/to/project
```
or alternatively specify a package from a public package repository:
```console
$ it-depends pip:numpy
$ it-depends apt:libc6@2.31
$ it-depends npm:lodash@>=4.17.0
```

It-Depends will output the full dependency hierarchy in JSON format. Additional output formats such
as Graphviz/Dot are available via the `--output-format` option.

It-Depends can automatically try to match packages against the [OSV vulnerability database](https://osv.dev/) with the
`--audit` option. This is a best-effort matching as it is based on package names, which might not always consistent.
Any discovered vulnerabilities are added to the JSON output.

It-Depends attempts to parallelize as much of its effort as possible. To limit the maximum number of parallel tasks, use
the `--max-workers` option.

By default, It-Depends recursively resolves all packages' dependencies to construct a complete dependency graph. The
depth of the recursion can be limited using the `--depth-limit` option. For example,
```console
$ it-depends pip:graphtage --depth-limit 1
```
will only enumerate the direct dependencies of Graphtage.

### Examples üßë‚Äçüè´

Here is an example of running It-Depends on its own source repository:

This is the resulting [json](https://gist.github.com/feliam/2bdec76f7aa50602869059bfa14df156)
with all the discovered dependencies.
This is the resulting [Graphviz dot file](https://gist.github.com/feliam/275951f5788c23a477bc7cf758a32cc2)

This is the resulting dependency graph:

### It-Depends‚Äô Dependencies üé≠

JavaScript requires `npm`\
Rust requires `cargo`\
Python requires `pip`\
C/C++ requires `autotools` and/or `cmake`\
Several native dependencies are resolved using Ubuntu‚Äôs file to path database `apt-file`, but this is seamlessly
handled through an Ubuntu `docker` container on other distributions and operating systems\
Currently `docker` is used to resolve native dependencies

## Development üë∑
```commandline
$ git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/it-depends
$ cd it-depends
$ python3 -m venv venv  # Optional virtualenv
$ ./venv/bin/activate   # Optional virtualenv
$ pip3 install -e '.[dev]'
$ git config core.hooksPath ./hooks  # Optionally enable git commit hooks for linting
```
